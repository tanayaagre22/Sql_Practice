1. Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
Ans :SELECT CEIL(
           ABS(AVG(SALARY) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(SALARY, '0', '') AS DECIMAL(10,2))))
         ) AS ERROR_AMOUNT
FROM EMPLOYEES;

2.Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.

Note:  CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.:

Ans:select sum(city.population) as total_population from city 
inner join country 
on city.countrycode=country.code
where country.continent='asia'

3.Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.
Ans :select city.name from city
inner join country
on city.countrycode=country.code
where continent ='africa'

4.Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.
select country.continent, floor(avg(city.population)) as population
from city
inner join country
on
CITY.CountryCode =COUNTRY.Code
group by country.continent
