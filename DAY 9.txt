1.Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 388.770. Round your answer to  decimal places.
ANS : select round (LONG_W,4)
from station
where LAT_N= (select MIN(LAT_N) 
from station
where LAT_N > 38.7780);

2. Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION). 
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION). 
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION). 
d  happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION). 
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4  decimal places.

ANS :SELECT ROUND(
    ABS(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) + 
    ABS(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)), 
    4
) AS Manhattan_Distance
FROM STATION;

3. Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and (c,d) maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION. 

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1and P2  and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

ANS : select round (sqrt(power(max(lat_n)- min(lat_n),2)+ POWER(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W), 2)),4)
as euclidean_distance
                   from station;
