1.Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880  and less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
Ans: SELECT 
    TRUNCATE(SUM(LAT_N), 4) 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7880 
AND LAT_N < 137.2345;

2. Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to  decimal places.
Ans: select truncate(max(LAT_N),4)
from station 
where LAT_N <137.2345;

3.Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to  decimal places. 
Ans:select Round(LONG_W, 4)
from station 
where LAT_N =(Select max(LAT_N)
from station
where LAT_N < 137.2345);

4.  Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 388.70 . Round your answer to  decimal places.
ANS : select round(min(lat_n),4)
      from station
	where lat_n>388.70;
